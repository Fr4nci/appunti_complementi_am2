# Notes of the course "Complementi di Analisi Matematica 2"

Some notes I reorganised for the course "Complementi di Analisi Matematica 2" i'm currently attending at the University of Pisa, held by Valentino Magnani. If you found some errors, please let me know.
The course is intended as a brief introduction to multivariable calculus, since lots of topics that usually are related to the course "Analisi 2" of other italian universities are already been done in the one-year course of "Analisi Matematica" of the first year.
