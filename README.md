# Notes of the course "Complementi di Analisi Matematica 2"

These are notes I've reorganized from the course 'Complementi di Analisi Matematica 2,' which I'm currently taking at the University of Pisa. The course is taught by Valentino Magnani.
Please let me know if you find any errors. The course serves as a concise introduction to multivariable calculus. Unlike many similar courses at other Italian universities, it assumes that students have already completed the first-year 'Analisi Matematica' course and are familiar with its topics.
